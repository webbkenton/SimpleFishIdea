{
    //if player presses CatchFish
    //**After Catch Fish the Active pool should be decided**
    //**Coroutine that will randomly delay the ammount of time before the mark?**
    //After a few seconds an Exclamation mark will appear
    //Exclamation mark needs to stay active for a few seconds then disapear
    //While the exclamation mark is not visable it should not be clickable.
    //**Possibly make exclamation mark a button that tracks clicks**

    // If we click the exclamation point we want it to:
    // ++Counter, Disable the Exclamtion, Then Catch Fish.
    //Common Will be caught when Counter = 1;
    //Uncommon Caught when Counter =2;
    //Rare Will be Caught when Counter =3;
    //Legendary will be unique;
